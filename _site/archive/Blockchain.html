				<h2>Role</h2>
				<p>
					Co-founder and COO
				</p>
				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>
					<!-- remove ref to paper 
						<a target="_new" href="Papers/BookLocal_prospectus.pdf" id="paper">	
						</a> 
					-->
					BookLocal is an Ethereum based hotel distribution and
					property management system. The major advantage of using a
					blockchain for this purpose is that it enables hotels to
					join a
					distribution network without barriers. Currently, there is
					an effective
					duopoly in the online travel agency market (Expedia Group
					and Booking Holdings),
					with two main parent companies owning a majority the various
					online travel sites (e.g.
					Booking.com,
					Priceline.com, Kayak.com, and so on). This creates a
					situation where
					many hotels are asked to pay up to 30% commission per room
					rental. This rate can
					exclude many independent and small chain hotels from being
					competitive with
					larger chains.
				</p>
				<h2>ERC-809</h2>
				<p>
					In order to rent assets on the blockchian, I proposed a
					standard
					interface in <a target="_new"
						href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/809">ERC-809</a>
					(Ethereum Request for Comment). The advantage of having a
					consistent
					way of interfacing with rentable assets is that users can
					then
					see all of their blockchain-based rentals from a single
					wallet application.
					This means that if you go on a trip, you could open a single
					application and
					find your flight, hotel, car, and dinner reservations.
				</p>
				<p>
					This ERC has been used in various other projects, most
					notably in a
					ConsenSys based project that deals with office and real
					estate rentals.
					Currently, I'm working on an implementation (<a
						target="_new"
						href="https://github.com/slee981/ERC809-General">here</a>)
					that provides an inheritable abstraction for
					renting any asset for arbitrary durration without affecting
					the gas price.
				</p>

				<h2>Proof-of-Concept</h2>
				<p>
					For our first version proof-of-concept, we built a simple
					version of the product
					and released it on the Rinkeby test network. This version
					was used to
					reserve the first ever blockchain based rentals at the <a
						target="_new" href="https://ethmemphis.com/">
						EthMemphis</a> hackathon and workshop event in May 2018.
					Here is a short excerpt
					that includes a video of the <a target="_new"
						href="https://medium.com/@booklocal/hotel-booking-and-guest-management-on-the-ethereum-blockchain-beddcfa2040">
						proof-of-concept</a>, and here is a short write-up <a
						target="_new"
						href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/heres-what-happened-gracelands-ethereum-conference/">
						that summarizes the event.</a> .
				</p>
				<h2>Current</h2>
				<p>
					We are currently developing the second generation of the
					product.
					This includes a mobile interface for travelers, a tablet
					based
					interface for hotels, and updated smart-contracts.

				<p>
					Blockchain's are a hot topic right now,
					and there is a lot of misinformation.
					To better understand what
					a blockchain is and what it isn't, I
					wrote a paper that compares and contrasts
					the Ethereum blockchain to the Bitcoin blockchain.
					I also wrote a simulation in Python that
					emphasizes the key features.
				</p>
				<h2>Blockchain Basics: A Dive into Ethereum and Bitcoin</h2>
				<p>
					<a target="_new"
						href="Papers/StephenLee_BlockchainPaper.pdf" id="paper">
						<b>Abstract: </b>Public blockchains and their
						corresponding cryptocurrencies
						have captured the imagination of many in recent years.
						Since the release
						of Bitcoin, several other projects, most notably one
						called Ethereum,
						have extended the key insights to allow code of
						arbitrary complexity to
						run securely on these public networks. This paper
						describes the main
						problem that they seek to solve and then proceeds to
						compare and contrast
						the implementations of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Finally, I
						suggest
						an evaluation of the Ethereum blockchain as a
						distributed system based
						on how well it makes resources available and provides
						user transparency,
						openness, and scalability.
					</a>
				</p>

				<h2>Code</h2>
				<p>
					To provide a more interactive description, I wrote
					a small blockchain simulation in Python. The code
					can be found <a target="_new"
						href="https://github.com/slee981/Blockchain-Simulation">
						on my GitHub</a>. To use, clone the repository and
					follow the instructions on the README.md.
				</p>

				<a id="events" class="anchorRef"></a>
				<h1 id="contentSection">Events</h1>
				<p>
					I have been involved with a couple
					Ethereum hackathons and workshop events.
				</p>
				<h2>EthMemphis</h2>
				<p>
					<a target="_new"
						href="https://ethmemphis.com/">EthMemphis</a>
					was the Southeast's first major
					blockchain event. As a co-organizer,
					I managed website content and design, email
					communication with the attendees, and
					speaker recruitment.
				</p>

				<h2>EthAtlanta</h2>
				<p>
					<a target="_new" href="https://ethatl.com/">EthAtlanta</a>
					followed a few months after EthMemphis with a simlar
					business application focus. I spoke here with a
					talk titled "Private Enterprise on Public Blockchains".
