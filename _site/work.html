        <h3 class="card-title">Variation in Political News: An NLP Approach</h3>
        <div class="card-text">
            <p>
                <b>Abstract: </b>By many reports, there has been an
                increase in skepticism
                and polarity in news consumption. Since 2016, we have
                even heard the president
                of the United States make accusations of traditionally
                mainstream news sources
                publishing "fake news". With a goal of classifying news
                articles by their source,
                I scraped several thousand political news articles from
                Fox, Vox, and PBS News.
                I then trained a bidirectional LSTM netural network to
                classify the source of the
                article based on the text. Accuracy was measured by
                calculating the F1 score, on
                which the best model scored a 0.946 on the out of sample
                classification task.
                To interact with this tool, I developed a web
                application that implements the
                trained network. Finally, I considered the social
                implications of such a tool.

            <p>
                <b>Abstract: </b>The Federal Reserve System was created
                by an act of Congress in 1913,
                and they are tasked with a so called “dual mandate” to
                1) promote full employment
                and 2) ensure price stability. In practice, the most
                traditional tool that they have
                to achieve these goals is by setting the interest rate
                at which large banking
                institutions can lend to each other overnight. This rate
                is known as the federal
                funds rate, and it is decided by the Federal Open
                Markets Committee (FOMC) in meetings
                that occur about every six (6) weeks. In between meeting
                dates, members
                of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors – a group that
                is always allowed to vote on
                the interest rate decision – may give speeches to the
                public during scheduled events.
                One might wonder, do these speeches contain information
                about their upcoming decisions?
                Performing an analysis using a Latent Dirchelt Alocation
                (LDA) fit on the cleaned text
                of speeches, I find evidence to suggest that these
                speeches do in fact seem to contain
                information that is useful in predicting future interest
                rate decisions.

        <h3 class="card-title">Cointegrated Cryptocurrencies? An Exploration of Price Movements</h3>
        <div class="card-text">
            <p>
                <b>Abstract: </b>The original Bitcoin whitepaper was
                released in 2008 under the pseudonym
                Satoshi Nakamoto (Nakamoto, 2008). Here, the author
                introduces a
                novel way of enabling secure peer-to-peer digital
                transactions without so-
                called “double spending” attacks. Traditionally, these
                attacks are avoided
                through the use of banks and other intermediaries (i.e.
                Paypal, Venmo)
                who ensure that users transact honestly. With Bitcoin,
                however, double
                spending is prevented through a clever combination of
                cryptography and
                game theory. Since then, other projects (for example,
                Buterin, 2013)
                have modified the original Bitcoin protocol to create
                new blockchains,
                each with their own coins. Colloquially referred to as
                “cryptocurrencies”,
                these projects have captured the imagination of many. As
                of February
                23, 2019, the three largest cryptocurrencies by market
                capitalization are
                Bitcoin ($ 72.6 Billion), Ether ($ 16.6 Billion), and
                Ripple ($ 13.6 Billion).
                Following MacDonald and Taylor, 1989 and Sephton and
                Larsen, 1991,
                I explore price movements in the cryptocurrency market
                by looking for
                cointegrating relationships between the various coins.
                While not necessarily
                indicative of a market inefficiency, I do find some
                evidence to suggest price
                changes in Bitcoin may precede similar changes in the
                price of
                Litecoin, and further that none of the cryptocurrencies’
                prices appear to
                change independently of the others. Further, I find that
                investors seem to
                respond to negative price changes with an increase in
                volatility.

        <h3 class="card-title">Loss Aversion in Experts: Evidence from the PGA
            Tour</h3>
        <div class="card-text">
            <p>
                <b>Abstract: </b>I study loss aversion in professional
                golf using a proprietary dataset.
                I exploit the fact that professional golfers
                face a “cut” after the second round of a tournament in
                order to group
                players into two categories: those who make the cut (and
                receive prize
                money) and those who miss the cut (and go home with
                nothing). Due
                to this structure, golfers can observe their position
                after the first round
                and decide on a strategy. Empirical analysis supports my
                predictions
                that 1) players inside the projected cut choose a less
                risky strategy in the
                second round than players outside the projected cut; 2)
                players inside the
                projected cut after the first round, after controlling
                for position differences,
                make the cut more often than players outside of the
                projected cut; and
                3) the magnitude of the effects are smaller for
                tournaments with more
                skilled players. These results are consistent with the
                current loss aversion
                literature.

                <b>Abstract: </b>Since the introduction of Bitcoin and
                the underlying blockchain tech-
                nology, several alternative protocols have been created.
                This paper explores
                one of those alternatives, Ethereum, to examine the
                behavior of
                users and infrastructure providers. While more research
                is needed for
                robustness, I find tentative results that suggest: 1)
                infrastructure providers
                (called "miners") are currently able to operate at a
                profit, suggesting there
                is not a competitive equilibrium. Still, it would take a
                new miner approximately
                four months to breakeven from the fixed equipment cost;
                2) users
                are willing to pay higher transaction fees, on average,
                in times of increased
                congestion, which is consistent with existing literature
                on queuing theory;
                and 3) decreasing rewards for infrastructure providers
                correlate with an
                increased level of infrastructure. Possible explanations
                for this include a
                time lag between deciding to become a miner and actually
                obtaining the
                necessary equipment.
