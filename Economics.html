					<h2>Loss Aversion: Evidence from the PGA Tour</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="Papers/StephenLee_PGALossAversion.pdf" id="paper">
						<b>Abstract: </b>I study loss aversion in professional golf using a proprietary dataset. 
						I exploit the fact that professional golfers
						face a “cut” after the second round of a tournament in order to group
						players into two categories: those who make the cut (and receive prize
						money) and those who miss the cut (and go home with nothing). Due
						to this structure, golfers can observe their position after the first round
						and decide on a strategy. Empirical analysis supports my predictions
						that 1) players inside the projected cut choose a less risky strategy in the
						second round than players outside the projected cut; 2) players inside the
						projected cut after the first round, after controlling for position differences,
						make the cut more often than players outside of the projected cut; and
						3) the magnitude of the effects are smaller for tournaments with more
						skilled players. These results are consistent with the current loss aversion
						literature.

					<h2>Cointegrated Cryptocurrencies? A Timeseries Analysis</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="Papers/StephenLee_DigitalAsset_Analysis.pdf" id="paper">
						<b>Abstract: </b>The original Bitcoin whitepaper was released in 2008 under the pseudonym
						Satoshi Nakamoto (Nakamoto, 2008). Here, the author introduces a
						novel way of enabling secure peer-to-peer digital transactions without so-
						called “double spending” attacks. Traditionally, these attacks are avoided
						through the use of banks and other intermediaries (i.e. Paypal, Venmo)
						who ensure that users transact honestly. With Bitcoin, however, double
						spending is prevented through a clever combination of cryptography and
						game theory. Since then, other projects (for example, [Buterin, 2013])
						have modified the original Bitcoin protocol to create new blockchains,
						each with their own coins. Colloquially referred to as “cryptocurrencies”,
						these projects have captured the imagination of many. As of February
						23, 2019, the three largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are
						Bitcoin ($ 72.6 Billion), Ether ($ 16.6 Billion), and Ripple ($ 13.6 Billion).
						Following MacDonald and Taylor, 1989 and Sephton and Larsen, 1991,
						I explore price movements in the cryptocurrency market by looking for
						cointegrating relationships between the various coins. While not neces-
						sarily indicative of a market inefficiency, I do find some evidence to sug-
						gest price changes in Bitcoin may precede similar changes in the price of
						Litecoin, and further that none of the cryptocurrencies’ prices appear to
						change independently of the others. Further, I find that investors seem to
						respond to negative price changes with an increase in volatility.

					<h2>An Emperical Analysis of the Ethereum Blockchain</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="Papers/StephenLee_EthereumMiningPaper.pdf" id="paper">
						<b>Abstract: </b>Since the introduction of Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain tech-
						nology, several alternative protocols have been created. This paper explores 
						one of those alternatives, Ethereum, to examine the behavior of
						users and infrastructure providers. While more research is needed for 
						robustness, I find tentative results that suggest: 1) infrastructure providers
						(called “miners”) are currently able to operate at a profit, suggesting there
						is not a competitive equilibrium. Still, it would take a new miner approx-
						imately four months to breakeven from the fixed equipment cost; 2) users
						are willing to pay higher transaction fees, on average, in times of increased
						congestion, which is consistent with existing literature on queuing theory;
						and 3) decreasing rewards for infrastructure providers correlate with an
						increased level of infrastructure. Possible explanations for this include a
						time lag between deciding to become a miner and actually obtaining the
						necessary equipment.

					<h2>Advertising for Consideration</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268118302981?via%3Dihub" id="paper">
						<b>Abstract: </b>We analyze markets where firms competing on price advertise to 
						increase the probability of entering consumers’ consideration sets. We find that 
						moderately costly advertising allows firms to raise prices and possibly profits 
						by reducing the fraction of price-conscious consumers, and by segmenting the 
						market according to whether or not consumers consider the lower priced firm. 
						However, when the cost of advertising is sufficiently low, advertising 
						leads to a prisoners’ dilemma that adversely impacts profits without 
						affecting expected prices.
